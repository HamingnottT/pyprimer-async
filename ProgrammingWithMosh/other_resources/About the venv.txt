Venv = a virtual environment in python projects that is independant from the global python installation/interpreter

+ Has its own python interpreter under Scripts folder

+ pip installs go in this virtual environment preventing clutter of the main/global pip installer environment

-> to create and activate a virtual environment in the project working directory in VScode:

	1. In the terminal to create, 
		- $ python -3 -m venv .venv
		- > python -3 -m venv .venv
		
	2. In the terminal to activate,
		- $ source .venv/Scripts/activate ~~~~ To deactivate: source .venv/Scripts/deactivate
		- > .venv\Scripts\activate.bat ~~~~~~~ To deactivate: .venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat
		
-> to install modules and librarys from pip in venv

	1. Create a requirements.txt if you know/have the library version,
		- in a second terminal call:
			$ pip freeze
			to list all global pip installs - the format can be pasted into the requirements.txt
			$ pip install -r requirements.txt
		
	2. Classic pip install,
		$ pip install pyspark
