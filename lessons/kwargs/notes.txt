In functions, you are typically dealing with positional arguments.
As such these args are read base on the postion that they are defined

ex. greet_user(first_name, last_name):

This example shows positional arguements, where first name must always be defined before the last name
inputing anything else beside the aforementioned causes side effects

greet_user("John", "Smith")

greet_user("Smith", "John")

granted this isn't he best example because if we were to add a print statement to this function calling the args
it would return both strings but in different order based on their coding.

In other programs, there is a much more profound effect, especially when a function is taking other types
in addition to strings. this is where positional order matters most.

kwargs = keyword arguments

kwargs handle arguements in a much more dynamic way.
