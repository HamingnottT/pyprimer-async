Anaconda = an open-source version of Python that comes prepackaged with necessary Data Science and ML tools

Conda = Anaconda's built-in package manager similar to pip with a few differences

-> setting up for first time:
	1. Make sure these directories from the installation folder are added to PATH:
		- %anaconda3%\Library\bin
		- %anaconda3%\Scripts
		- %anaconda3%

+ You can create project environments using conda

-> to create an environment similar to a venv in the working directory:
	
	1. In the terminal to create,
		- > conda create --prefix .\<chosen name> <extra options & python version>
		What I use:
		- > conda create --prefix .\.envs

	2. In the terminal to activate,
		- > conda activate .\<chosen name> ~~~~ To deactivate: conda deactivate
		What I use:
		- > conda create --prefix .\.envs  ~~~~ To deactivate: conda deactivate
